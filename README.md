# win32_sudo
sudo for Standard Users in Windows without a visible Admin


if you don't want to use an Administrator account for daily usage, try this tool.


You need to create an admin account, and a non-admin account, and login as the latter one.


Then use this tool: sudo _hide

to make admin invisible. 


Some switches are available: [_hide|_unhide|_transform|_restore]


_hide, _unhide are to control the visibility of admin;


_transform, _restore are to make current user admin or restore.


Make Windows Clean!
